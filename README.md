# Housing-Price-Analysis-using-Matplotlib
## Project Objectives:
1. Average Median Income and Data Distribution:
Calculate the average median income of the dataset.
Visualize the distribution of the data using appropriate plots.
Explain the observations made from the distribution plot.
2. Distribution of Housing Median Age:
Draw an appropriate plot to visualize the distribution of housing_median_age.
Provide insights and explanations based on the observations.
3. Relationship Between Median Income and Median House Values:
Use visualization to depict the relationship between median_income and median_house_values.
Explain the insights derived from the visualization.
4. Handling Missing Data:
Create a new dataset by removing examples with unavailable total_bedrooms.
5. Imputing Missing Data:
Create another dataset by filling missing data in total_bedrooms with the mean value.
6. User-Defined Function for Median Calculation:
Implement a user-defined function to calculate the median value of the dataset.
7. Filtering Data Based on Ocean Proximity:
Create a dataset where ocean_proximity is 'Near ocean'.
8. Mean and Median of Median Income for 'Near Ocean' Data:
Find the mean and median of the median income for the 'Near ocean' dataset.
9. Creating a New Column:
Add a new column named 'total_bedroom_size' based on specified conditions.
